        <p>By <b>55,000</b> years ago, the first modern humans, or Homo sapiens, 
            had arrived on the Indian subcontinent from Africa, where they had earlier evolved.[28][29][30] 
            The earliest known modern human remains in <strong>South Asia</strong> date to about 30,000 years ago.[28] After 6500 BCE, evidence for domestication of food crops and animals, 
            construction of permanent structures, and storage of agricultural surplus appeared in Mehrgarh and other sites in Balochistan, Pakistan.[84] 
            <br>These gradually developed into the <mark>Indus Valley Civilisation</mark>,[85][84] the first urban culture in South Asia,[86] which flourished during 2500â€“1900 BCE in Pakistan and western India.[87] 
            Centred around cities such as Mohenjo-daro, <strike>Harappa</strike>, Dholavira, and Kalibangan, and relying on varied forms of subsistence, the civilisation engaged robustly in crafts production and wide-ranging trade.[86]
